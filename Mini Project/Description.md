Name of the project : CARD GAME WAR

DETAILS OF PROJECT

1. Project Structure and Classes

Card Class: Represents an individual playing card.
Attributes: suit, rank, value
Methods: A method to display or print card details, or compare card values.

Deck Class: Manages a deck of 52 cards, shuffling and dealing cards.
Attributes: A list of Card objects.
Methods:
shuffle: Randomly shuffle the deck.
deal: Deal one or more cards from the top of the deck.

Player Class: Represents each player, managing their hand and game actions.
Attributes: name, a list of Card objects as their hand.
Methods:
draw_card: Draws the top card from the player's hand.
add_cards: Adds cards won to the bottom of the player's hand.
has_cards: Checks if the player still has cards (determines if they are in the game).

WarGame Class: Manages the overall game flow, including rounds and war situations.
Attributes: Two Player objects, central Deck object for initial setup.
Methods:
start_game: Deals half of the deck to each player.
play_round: Players draw a card to compare. Handles wars when ranks are tied.
declare_winner: Determines and prints the winner when one player has all cards.




2. Game Logic

Card Comparison:
When players draw cards, compare their values.
Higher-ranked card wins; the winner collects both cards and adds them to their hand.


War Condition:
If the cards are of equal rank, a "war" is declared.
Each player places a few cards face down and draws one more card to determine the winner.
The winner takes all the cards in play; if there's another tie, the war continues with additional rounds.



3. Steps to Implement

    1. Define Constants: Define card suits and ranks, and assign values (e.g., 2–10, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, etc.).
    2. Create Card, Deck, and Player classes.
    3. Shuffle and Deal: Shuffle the deck and split it between the players.
    4. Main Game Loop:
    Players draw cards and compare.
    If there’s a war, draw additional cards as required by the rules.
    5. Check for Winner: The game ends when one player has all the cards.



4. Additional Considerations

Edge Cases:
Handle situations where a player may not have enough cards during a war.
Limit the game to prevent infinite loops (optional, in case of very prolonged games).

Enhancements (Optional):
Add custom player names, or allow multiple games and track wins.
Create a visualization or text-based interface for rounds.


5.UI:
    Text-based: No extra libraries needed, use Python’s built-in input() and print() functions.
    Graphical: Use Tkinter (lightweight) or Pygame (more advanced).

6.Backend/Storage:
    File-based: Use JSON (easy, readable) or Pickle (more Python-specific).
    Database: Use SQLite for lightweight, persistent storage of game data.

7.Libraries:
    Standard: Python's random module for shuffling.
    Optional: unittest for testing, Matplotlib for stats visualizations
