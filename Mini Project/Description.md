Name of the project : CARD GAME WAR

DETAILS OF PROJECT

1. Project Structure and Classes

Card Class: Represents an individual playing card.
Attributes: suit, rank, value
Methods: A method to display or print card details, or compare card values.

Deck Class: Manages a deck of 52 cards, shuffling and dealing cards.
Attributes: A list of Card objects.
Methods:
shuffle: Randomly shuffle the deck.
deal: Deal one or more cards from the top of the deck.

Player Class: Represents each player, managing their hand and game actions.
Attributes: name, a list of Card objects as their hand.
Methods:
draw_card: Draws the top card from the player's hand.
add_cards: Adds cards won to the bottom of the player's hand.
has_cards: Checks if the player still has cards (determines if they are in the game).

WarGame Class: Manages the overall game flow, including rounds and war situations.
Attributes: Two Player objects, central Deck object for initial setup.
Methods:
start_game: Deals half of the deck to each player.
play_round: Players draw a card to compare. Handles wars when ranks are tied.
declare_winner: Determines and prints the winner when one player has all cards.




2. Game Logic

Card Comparison:
When players draw cards, compare their values.
Higher-ranked card wins; the winner collects both cards and adds them to their hand.


War Condition:
If the cards are of equal rank, a "war" is declared.
Each player places a few cards face down and draws one more card to determine the winner.
The winner takes all the cards in play; if there's another tie, the war continues with additional rounds.



3. Steps to Implement

    1. Define Constants: Define card suits and ranks, and assign values (e.g., 2–10, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, etc.).
    2. Create Card, Deck, and Player classes.
    3. Shuffle and Deal: Shuffle the deck and split it between the players.
    4. Main Game Loop:
    Players draw cards and compare.
    If there’s a war, draw additional cards as required by the rules.
    5. Check for Winner: The game ends when one player has all the cards.



4. Additional Considerations

Edge Cases:
Handle situations where a player may not have enough cards during a war.
Limit the game to prevent infinite loops (optional, in case of very prolonged games).

Enhancements (Optional):
Add custom player names, or allow multiple games and track wins.
Create a visualization or text-based interface for rounds.


5.Libraries Used
   1.random:Used to shuffle the deck of cards in the Deck class.
   2.tkinter:A Python standard library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
   3.messagebox from tkinter:Used to display pop-up messages for errors or game-over announcements.

6.UI (Frontend)
    1.tkinter:All UI components are built using tkinter.
    2.Key UI elements:
        Frames: Used to organize the layout (e.g., main menu vs. gameplay screen).
        Labels: Display static text (like "Player 1 Card") and dynamic content (like card names and results).
        Buttons: Allow players to start the game, play the next round, and restart the game.
        Entry Fields: For players to input their names.
        Styled Card Display: Cards are represented as Labels with a white background to simulate card visuals.
        Dynamic Updates: Labels update after every round to show the current card and results dynamically.


7.Backend
    1.Core Game Logic:
        Card Class: Represents a single card with a suit, rank, and value.
        Deck Class: Handles the creation of the deck and shuffling.
        Player Class: Manages each player's card stack.
        WarGame Class: Implements the core rules of the "War" card game, including tie resolution and determining winners.
    2.Game State Management:
        Game progress (rounds, winners, and remaining cards) is tracked by the WarGame class.
        The backend sends results to the UI for display after every round.
    3.Game Flow:
        Players input their names, and the deck is distributed evenly.
        The play_round() method handles each round:
        Compares cards.
        Allocates cards to the winner.
        Handles ties (simulating "war").
        The game ends when one player has all the cards or a set number of rounds is reached.
